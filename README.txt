Monster Fight Arena - Read Me
------------------------------------

The goal of this game is to fight against randomised monsters. A random monster will be selected each time you select the "Fight" option in the Main Menu. The three monsters available are the Slime, Zombie and Mutant Spider.

In a fight, you can either Strike or Guard. Strike damages the enemy, while Guard prevents the enemy from damaging you so much (significantly reducing its damage towards you so that you can preserve your health).
