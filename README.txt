Monster Fight Arena - Read Me
------------------------------------

The goal of this game is to fight against randomised monsters. A random monster will be selected each time you select the "Fight" option in the Main Menu. The three monsters available are the Slime, Zombie and Mutant Spider.

In a fight, you can either Strike or Guard. Strike damages the enemy, while Guard prevents the enemy from damaging you so much (significantly reducing its damage towards you so that you can preserve your health).

Controls
--------

In this game, you mainly navigate through menus by typing 1-3 when prompted to do so.

Known Bugs/Issues
-----------------

- When the player's weapon upgrades at the end of a fight, nothing actually happens. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a solution to this in time.
- The situation is the same for healing - healing currently doesn't do anything.
- Sometimes, when the player selects the Fight option in the main menu, a blank enemy appears. I haven't found the solution to this for a while, but if you just reload the game or initiate another fight, then a valid enemy should appear.
